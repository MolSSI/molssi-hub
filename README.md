# MOLSSI-AI Container Hub

The MolSSI-AI Container Hub for computational molecular science

## OVERVIEW

The MolSSI-AI Container Hub hosts a collection of curated, free and open-source
Dockerfile and Apptainer (Singularity) image recipes to containarize major open-source
scientific software and industrial training resources in artificial intelligence,
data science, machine learning and computational molecular science. Our mission is to
to minimize the burden of dealing with the complexities of setting up the scientific
software and managing their dependencies and to boost research productivity and
reproducibility across all domains of computational molecular sciences.
